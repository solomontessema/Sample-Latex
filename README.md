# Sample LaTeX Project: Integration by Parts in Multivariable Calculus

This repository contains a LaTeX document that outlines the proof of integration by parts in multivariable calculus, demonstrating the application of the divergence theorem. This sample is intended to showcase my proficiency with LaTeX, particularly in the context of complex mathematical documentation.

## Project Structure

- `main.tex`: The LaTeX source file containing the proof of integration by parts in multivariable calculus.
- `main.pdf`: The rendered PDF document generated from the `main.tex` file.

## Introduction

The sample document explores the proof of integration by parts for functions defined over a domain in $\(\mathbb{R}^3\)$, utilizing the divergence theorem to relate the flux of a vector field through a surface to the divergence of the field inside the volume bounded by the surface. This mathematical exposition is presented with clarity and precision, adhering to high standards of mathematical notation.

## How to Compile

To compile the `main.tex` file to a PDF:

1. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).
2. Run the following command in the terminal (for TeX Live):
